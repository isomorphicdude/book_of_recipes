# Hot Green Pepper Sauce
Mom has two signature sauces that I find myself craving so often that the actual dish is merely a way to consume said sauce. The first is her Red Hot Pepper Sauce, which we love with meats, and then this bright green hot pepper sauce, which we slather on any and all seafood.

## Ingredients
* 2 peppers
* 1 garlic
* 1/4 cup water
* 1/4 cup lime juice

## Instructions
* blend peppers, garlic, water
* transfer to a bowl
